# BroadcastReceiver Example

## Overview

If you would like notifications from Engine in the appâ€™s background state we recommend integrating Engine via BroadcastReceivers as opposed to Listeners.  We provide the following abstract classes that extend BroadcastReceivers:

- `FactualActionReceiver`: replaces `FactualActionHandler`
- `FactualClientReceiver`: replaces `FactualClientListener`

## Integration

The main difference between our Listener example and BroadcastReceiver example is that you must reference your Receivers in your AndroidManifest.xml.  We do the following in our example:

```xml
...
        <receiver android:name=".ConsoleLoggingActionReceiver"/>
        <receiver android:name=".ConsoleLoggingFactualClientReceiver"/>
    </application>
...
```

The `ConsoleLoggingActionReceiver` extends `FactualActionReceiver` and the `ConsoleLoggingFactualClientReceiver` extends `FactualClientReceiver`.

Setting or registering a receiver is also a little different, for example:

Setting the `FactualClientReceiver` in `MainActivity.java`:

```java
...
FactualEngine.setListener(ConsoleLoggingFactualClientReceiver.class);
...
```

Registering the `FactualActionReceiver` in `ConsoleLoggingFactualClientReceiver.java`:

```java
...
FactualEngine.registerAction(actionId, ConsoleLoggingActionReceiver.class);
...
```
